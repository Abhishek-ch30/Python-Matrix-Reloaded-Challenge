#Matrix Operations Challenge

##Key Results

Execution Time: Optimized to 1.8167e-05 seconds.

Results:

Matrix multiplication: [[7, 10], [15, 22]]

Complex expression: [[224, 224], [352, 352]]

Memory Usage:  328 bytes (post-optimization).

##Optimizations Explaination and Impacts:

Vectorized Computations: Utilized NumPy functions for faster and more efficient operations.

Memory Management: Avoided intermediate variables and reduced redundant memory allocations.

Efficient Calculations: Reordered operations to minimize redundant computations.
